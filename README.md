# polarsys-userspace

This repository contains userspace applications running directly on the Polarsys Rover, or that can be used to interact with it.

Here is a short description of the subdirectories:

* rover_mqtt: The main rover application, exposing the rover's controls and sensors through an MQTT interface.
* utils: A collection of miscellaneous scripts to run on the rover or to interact with it.
* web_dashboard: Web front-end that displays the rover's sensor values and allows sending control commands.
